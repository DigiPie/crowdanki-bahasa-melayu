## Guideline

To improve learning efficiency, relevant concepts are combined into a single card:

| Card # | Front                 | Back                           |
| -----: | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
|      1 | Comel (Si comel)      | Cute (Cutie)                   |
|      2 | Dekat - Jauh          | Near - Far                     |
|      3 | Muda (Pemuda, Pemudi) | Young (Young man, Young woman) |
|      4 | Muda - Tua            | Young - Old                    |

As you can see in card 3 and 4, 'Muda' appears twice given that it is related to 'Pemuda, Pemudi' and also to 'Lama / Tua'.
