# Introduction to Bahasa Melayu
A repo for collaborative Anki learning of Bahasa Melayu via the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) plugin. Card decks are stored in the `.json` format.

This is a work-in-progress - the card decks are currently being udpated, vetted for mistakes, and sorted appropriately. It is currently a mess. A decent `v0.1.0` release will be released by end May 2020.
