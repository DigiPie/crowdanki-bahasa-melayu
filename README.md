# Introduction to Bahasa Melayu

A repo for collaborative Anki learning of Bahasa Melayu via the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) plugin. Card decks are stored in the `.json` format.

This is a work-in-progress - the card decks are currently being udpated, vetted for mistakes, and sorted appropriately. It is currently a mess. A decent `v0.1.0` release will be released by end May 2020.

## Content

| No. | Subject            | Description                                       |
|----:|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|   1 | melayu-convo       | Proper commonly-used sentences and vocabulary.    |
|   2 | melayu-informal    | Informal day-to-day speech.                       |
|   3 | melayu-intro-body  | Basic human anatomy.                              |
|   4 | melayu-intro-exam  | Sentences which test basic language mastery.      |
|   5 | melayu-vocab       | Less-commonly used vocabulary.                    |

## Rules

1. To improve learning efficiency, relevant concepts are combined into a single card:

|  Card # | Front | Back |
|--------:|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
|       1 | Comel (Si comel)      | Cute (Cutie)                   |
|       2 | Dekat - Jauh          | Near - Far                     |
|       3 | Muda (Pemuda, Pemudi) | Young (Young man, Young woman) |
|       4 | Muda - Lama / Tua     | Young - Old                    |

As you can see in card 3 and 4, 'Muda' appears twice given that it is related to 'Pemuda, Pemudi' and also to 'Lama / Tua'.
